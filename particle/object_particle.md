### Object Particle

The marker を is attached to things or people, and means that they are the target of the verb. 
Subjects are often omitted in Japanese sentences. 
Unlike English, the location of the verbs are usually at the end of the sentence. 

|Object|を|Verb|English|
|------|--|----|-------|
