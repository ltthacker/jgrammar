### The verbs あります and います

あります and います are very special verbs in Japanese that refer to somethings's existence.
They are often translated into English as there is or there are.
Even though they are often translated identically, they describe different objects:
* あります is used for **inanimate object**, like books, rooms, televisions, and apples.
* います is used for **animate object**, like people, animals.
