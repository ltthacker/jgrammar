### Pronouns

Pronouns are relatively rare in Japanese, but they are sometimes used to explicitly specify the subject or topic of a sentence.
Below are some of the most common ones.

|Person|Singular|Plural|
|------|--------|------|
|First|私・わたし is used in polite settings by women and men, used by women in most other settings. 僕・ぼく is used by men in informal settings.|私たち is most common. 我々・われわれ sounds rather stiff and business-like|
|Second|・さん|きみたち|
|Third - Male|彼|彼ら|
|Third - Female|彼女|彼女たち|
